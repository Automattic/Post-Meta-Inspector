Peer inside your post meta

== Description ==

A quick and easy way to see post meta associated with any given post. When activated, this plugin prints your post meta keys and values inside of a post meta box.

Originally developed for [WordPress.com VIP](http://vip.wordpress.com/)-hosted clients, we thought it would be useful for development environments, etc. too. Feel free to [fork the plugin in Github](https://github.com/Automattic/Post-Meta-Inspector) and pull requests are always welcome. Hit us with feedback, questions, bug reports, and feature requests in the forums.
